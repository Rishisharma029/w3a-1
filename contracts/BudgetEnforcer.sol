/// @title BudgetEnforcer
/// @author W3A-1 Team
/// @notice Authoritative, on-chain spending cap for an AI agent.
///
/// Security model
/// ==============
/// - Only `owner` can set budget / designate the agent.
/// - Only `agent` can call `authorize`.  The agent cannot modify its own
///   spending cap — it can only REQUEST authorization.
/// - Each `reqId` is a bytes32 one-time token.  Once used, it is permanently
///   marked — preventing replay / double-charge at the contract level.
/// - `totalSpent` is monotonically increasing; it is never decremented.
/// - If `totalSpent + amount` would exceed `maxBudget`, the call reverts and
///   ALL state changes are rolled back (including the reqId mark).
/// - The budget can only be increased by the owner (never decreased), so the
///   owner cannot retroactively invalidate already-recorded spend.
/// - Providers call the view function `verifyAuthorization` to confirm that a
///   reqId was authorized for exactly the right amount before delivering
///   content.  This is a cheap read-only call — no gas cost for providers.
///
/// Attack resistance
/// =================
/// - Agent attempting overspend → reverts (check before state change).
/// - Agent replaying an old reqId → reverts (usedRequests check first).
/// - Unauthorized address calling authorize → reverts (onlyAgent modifier).
/// - Reentrancy during authorize → blocked by ReentrancyGuard.
/// - Provider verifying an unrecognized reqId → returns false (no delivery).
/// - Owner trying to decrease budget below totalSpent → reverts.
